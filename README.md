# .Net-in-Samples
While I was working at Microsoft, I started writing a book on .NET with a focus on security. The aim was to create a publication with clear examples explaining a certain functionality and at the same time its system background. Basically, I bring it here mainly for myself, because I would like to make some changes. But if the publication will also be useful for others, feel free to use it and extend it with additional sections. :-)
